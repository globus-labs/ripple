Overview
========

Deploying the Ripple agent on a device integrates it into a distributed data management fabric. Once installed, the agent is capable of monitoring the underlying file system for data events (e.g., file being created and modified). Using the management console (https://ripple.globuscs.info/) you can create custom rules comprised of triggers and actions.

You need a Globus (https://www.globus.org/) account in order to register an agent and log into the management console.
